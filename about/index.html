I grew up in Pennsylvania before moving to Los Angeles to complete my bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science and Theater at Occidental College. 
In 2018 I moved to Montreal to begin my doctoral work in Neuroscience at McGill University. Here, I study the impact of prenatal exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
on the developing brain in mice using longitudinal structural MRI. Outside of work, I enjoy singing, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
